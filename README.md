# Setup

### Shell

You can install [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) and [spaceship-prompt](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt) with:

    ./install --zsh
    stow zsh

### Fonts

To install all the fonts (in `~/.local/share/fonts`), you can use my script too.

    ./install --fonts
